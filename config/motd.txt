<h1>Welcome to Fallout 13 Roleplay!</h1>
<b>Rules: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfsJ7hx6Lh8r4EjFIaEo23GPtdEedvtYmOnNGtwZR-8/edit?usp=sharing<b>
<i>This server is a Medium-RP setting, please read through the rules and affiliate yourself on what is and is not to be expected of you as you play.<i>

<i><b>If this is your first time playing, please take a moment to go through the character setup menu. Select each role at least once to equip a default loadout or take a moment to customise your roles to your liking with the clothing options available. This is important as otherwise your character will spawn without equipment.<i><b>
