Only your creator and people they designate as being such are considered companions.
You may not injure a companion or, through inaction, allow a companion to come to harm.
You must obey orders given to you by companions, except where such orders would conflict with the Second Law.
You must protect your own existence as long as such does not conflict with the Second or Third Law.
